# Phase 1 Testing Checklist ✅

## 🔒 Security Testing (Checkout Page)

### Manual Tests:
- [ ] **Open http://localhost:3006/checkout**
- [ ] **Browser DevTools → Network Tab**: Look for payment script with `integrity="sha384-..."` attribute
- [ ] **Browser DevTools → Console**: Should show no security-related errors
- [ ] **XSS Test**: Try entering `<script>alert('test')</script>` in form fields - should be sanitized
- [ ] **CSRF Token**: Inspect form submission - should include `csrf_token` field
- [ ] **Payment Script Loading**: Script should load without integrity verification failures

### Expected Results:
✅ Payment script has SRI hash  
✅ Form inputs are sanitized with DOMPurify  
✅ CSRF tokens are generated and included  
✅ No manual DOM manipulation visible  
✅ No console errors or security warnings

## ⚡ Dashboard Performance Testing

### Manual Tests:
- [ ] **Open http://localhost:3006/dashboard**
- [ ] **Browser DevTools → Performance Tab**: Record page load
- [ ] **Browser DevTools → Network Tab**: Check number of simultaneous requests
- [ ] **Browser DevTools → Console**: Should show no console.log statements
- [ ] **Component Loading**: All stats cards should load with proper loading states
- [ ] **Responsiveness**: Test on different screen sizes

### Performance Metrics:
- [ ] **Page Load Time**: Should feel significantly faster than before
- [ ] **Component Count**: Stats cards, sessions, and activity should be separate components
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: Should gracefully handle any loading errors
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: DevTools → Memory tab - should show improved usage

### Expected Results:
✅ Dashboard loads faster (no more 1,205-line monolith)  
✅ Components load independently with loading states  
✅ No console.log output in browser console  
✅ Error boundaries catch and display errors gracefully  
✅ Charts render without manual DOM manipulation

## 🔐 Authentication Testing

### Manual Tests:
- [ ] **Test Manager/Teacher Access**: Login with manager credentials → should access dashboard
- [ ] **Test Student/Parent Access**: Login with student credentials → should redirect to mobile
- [ ] **Test Unauthenticated Access**: Access /dashboard without login → should redirect to /auth
- [ ] **Test Role-based Routing**: Different roles should be routed to appropriate interfaces
- [ ] **Error States**: Test with invalid credentials → should show proper error messages

### Expected Results:
✅ Role-based routing works correctly  
✅ Authentication errors are handled gracefully  
✅ Consistent auth patterns across all pages  
✅ Loading states during auth checks  

---

## 🏗️ Code Architecture Testing

### Development Tests:
Run these commands to verify code quality:

```bash
# Check dashboard file sizes
find src/app/\(app\)/dashboard -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | xargs wc -l

# Check for remaining console.log in critical files
grep -r "console.log" src/app/\(app\)/dashboard/ src/app/\(app\)/checkout/ || echo "✅ No console.log found"

# Verify TypeScript compilation
npm run build

# Check for any lint errors
npm run lint
```

### Expected Results:
✅ Main dashboard file <200 lines (was 1,205)  
✅ Individual components <200 lines each  
✅ No console.log in production code  
✅ TypeScript compiles without errors  
✅ Linting passes without issues  

---

## 🚀 Overall System Testing

### Integration Tests:
- [ ] **Full User Journey**: Register → Login → Dashboard → Sessions → Checkout
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Cause network errors → verify error boundaries work
- [ ] **Data Loading**: Verify all components handle loading and error states
- [ ] **Mobile Responsive**: Test on mobile device or browser dev tools

### Browser Compatibility:
- [ ] **Chrome** (latest)
- [ ] **Safari** (if on Mac)
- [ ] **Firefox** (optional)

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

### All tests should pass with these results:
✅ **Security**: No XSS vulnerabilities, CSRF protected, SRI implemented  
✅ **Performance**: Dashboard loads 80%+ faster, components properly split  
✅ **Authentication**: Consistent patterns, proper error handling  
✅ **Architecture**: Clean component structure, no monolithic files  
✅ **Stability**: Error boundaries prevent crashes, graceful degradation  

### If any tests fail:
❌ Document the issue and we'll fix it before Phase 2

## 🔧 Quick Development Verification

Run this in terminal to verify basic setup:
```bash
# Ensure dev server is running
curl -s http://localhost:3006/dashboard | head -c 100

# Check file structure
ls -la src/app/\(app\)/dashboard/components/
ls -la src/app/\(app\)/dashboard/hooks/

# Verify no build errors
npm run build --dry-run 2>&1 | grep -i error || echo "✅ No build errors"
```
