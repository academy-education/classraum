/**
 * The question-bank register — ONE source, two renderings.
 *
 * ── Why this is a module and not a markdown file ─────────────────────
 * The register started as `scripts/study-bank/REGISTER.md`, written by
 * hand, and the admin page described the same work in its own words.
 * Two hand-maintained copies of one list is how the list stops being
 * true: the page said the bank was 0% done for a day after the evidence
 * had changed, and findings were landing in commit messages nobody
 * re-reads.
 *
 * So the work items live here, typed. `/admin/bank-qc` imports this,
 * and `scripts/study-bank/render-register.mjs` regenerates the markdown
 * from it. Editing one place updates both; editing the markdown by hand
 * is overwritten on the next render, which is the point.
 *
 * Cohort STATE is deliberately NOT here — it is measured, not declared,
 * and the live route reads it from the database every load. Anything in
 * this file is a decision or a plan; anything measured comes from the
 * bank itself.
